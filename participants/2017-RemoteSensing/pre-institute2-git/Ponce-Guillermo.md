================

I am a Postdoc at the USDA-ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center (SWRC) working on the application of remote sensing technologies to study vegetation responses to environmental factors. My main interests focus on the use of remote sensing time series to study vegetation phenology stages and the use of vegetation indexes as proxies for estimating vegetation states, mainly productivity. I also work with geo-spatial tools, experimenting as needed, such as R-spatial tools, GDAL, Google Earth Engine, ESRI-ArcMap, QGIS, and Python, I used to do everything in IDL.

I really enjoy learning new things, meeting new people, and making work collaborations.

##### My goals for the Data Institute, I think are two:

-   To define a workflow that allows me to work with hyperspectral data from NEON flights. Our research unit (USDA-ARS, Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed) works with hydrology and vegetation applications that could benefit from having access to this type of data for future NEON flights around our site.
-   To try to use hyperspectral data to support soil and vegetation characterization within a watershed with similar characteristics to WGEW/SRER. The main components for this characteriztion include: plant species identification, plant productivity proxies, and the assessment of ecological sites states (still not sure how) based on data from Range Con specialists. Since one of the main goals in rangelands is to assess plant productivity, we could also use hyperspectral data to support ground surveys to identify pixels/zones from specific plant types/species and then use that identification to match it with its corresponding time series from sensors like PlanetLabs/Landsat/Sentinel2/NAIP.

Proposed Capstone Project
-------------------------

**Questions:**

1.  How can we use AOP data to support the validation of plant productivity estimates from satellite-measurements?
2.  How AOP data can be used in semi-arid shrub-grasslands? Learn from NEON's experiences using AOP data in this type of biome.

*I really would like to have the opportunity to start a collaboration to draft a study during the Data Institute week.*

From the research statement below, I'd like to achieve two things during Data Institute:

1.  To learn how to use AOP data for identifying/classifying areas based on plant species, not sure how far we can get with AOP and species identification.
2.  To Engage in a working collaboration with participants that could be interested in similar topics.

In case someone has similar interests, here is a rough statement on a potential research topic.

#### Grasslands Productivity Responses to Soil Moisture Patterns Under Altered Hydroclimatic Conditions

**Research question**

How does grasslands productivity respond to different soil moisture seasonal patterns (annual, summer, winter, lag-N averages) under altered hydroclimatic conditions?

**Hypotheses**

-   A significant decrease in average annual soil moisture (&gt; 1 *σ* over 13yr+ period) cause a substantial reduction in grasslands primary productivity
-   When average summer soil moisture over grasslands exhibit a significant increase (&gt; 1 *σ* over 13yr+ period), annual primary productivity exhibit a corresponding increase
-   With prolonged periods (2 or more consecutive years) of decreasing average summer soil moisture ( &gt; 2 *σ* over 13yr+ period) plant functioning and structure gets compromised

**Objective**

To assess the impact of altered hydroclimatic conditions on the relationship between soil moisture temporal patterns and the primary productivity of grasslands biomes.

**Data**

-   AOP data to identify zones/areas of plant species (La Jornada, SRER, CPER, ?)
-   Soil Moisture from different networks for grasslands biomes (SCAN, ARM, Fluxnet, USCRN, OZNET, NEON)
-   Vegetation indexes from satellite to obtain the primary productivity proxies by using annual integrated values (small and large integral of the growing season curve, amnd annual sum).

*Something else we could use from NEON/AOP ?*
