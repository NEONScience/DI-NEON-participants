#Michala Phillips
I am a PhD Candidate in Botany and Plant Sciences at UC Riverside. My research has mainly focused on community and ecosystem ecology. I recently accepted an opportunity to expand my skillset and start a remote sensing project.
##Domain of Interest
I am a soil ecologist with a specific interest in mycorrhizae. Thus far, I have used community and ecosystem ecological tools to study restoration and mycorrhizae. With my new project, I build off an existing framework using canopy spectral properties to detect mycorrhizal associations.  
###Goal for the course
I hope to increase my familiarity with Python and remote sensing tools. I am mainly interested in increasing my access to and understanding of the resources available to help me move into a the field of landscape and global ecology.
##Capstone Project
I am interested in finding imagery data and ground tree demography data to use as validation of a future model predicting the portion of forests that are arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal using Landsat imagery. I think NEON sites are great potential candidates for this ground-truth demography data and/or hi-resolution imagery data.
