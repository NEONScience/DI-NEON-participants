of programming, and I have loved that concave ever since.

## Education
Studied at the University of Nairobi for a Bachelor of Arts in Geography and Environmental Studies.

## Profession

Briefly worked in the climate change workspace before coming to terms creating things has been an inherent part of me.
Yet to confirm this (pun intended).
