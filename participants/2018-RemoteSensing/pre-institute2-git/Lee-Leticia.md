I am a Ph.D. student in georaphy at Boston University in the Department of Earth and Environment. I am originally from Texas and got my undergraduate degree in environmental science/biology at The University of Texas at Austin. Broadly, I am interested in the using remote sensing to measure canopy nitrogen in temperate forests of New England.  

One of my course goals is to learn more about how to integrate NEON AOP imagery along with other remotely sensed data (i.e. Landsat or Sentinel data) for my dissertation research focused on remote sesing of forest canopy chemistry and structure.

For fun, I enjoy:
* practicing yoga
* biking
* listening to podcasts
* reading funny memoirs

## Capstone Project
 
I am interested in investigating how the growing season phenology of Sentinel-2 imagery can be used to improve understanding of canopy-scale chlorophyll and nitrogen dynamics, between and within growing seasons. In addition to Sentinel-2 data, I will also be using NEON airborne data (including LIDAR imagery and canopy chemical measurements) to understand how the structural properties forest canopies (e.g. canopy composition and gap structure) influence reflectance measurements from space-borne sensors. 

For the capstone project, I hope to do some preliminary work comparing nitrogen measurements from AOP campaigns over Harvard Forest to spectral indices from moderate or high resolution remote sensing images (either from the same AOP campaigns or satellite-based images from around the same date).
